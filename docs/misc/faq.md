4. After you had finished the `/scriptevent` verification, you can start to use Matrix AntiCheat.

5. Do `-help` to view what command can you use.

## When I type help command, it shows something like "level 1", it is not working!

Do `-op`, thank you. Stop asking this question.

If it is not working, please make sure Matrix is above any chatRank addon (but below addon with chat command).

6. Reuploading your world back to your realm

Method 2: Use `-matrixui` to execute the command

1. Run `-matrixui` to open the matrix UI.

2. Select the command (action) that you want to execute

## Why Matrix is not working?

Possible reasons:

1. You have not enable Beta-API. (You can do `/function matrix/help` to check.)

Run the command `-setpassword <password>` to make a password.

You can also use `-clearpassword` to remove the password and back to `/scriptevent` verification mode.

## How to disable, enable and view the modules?

Use `-setmodule <module's toggle id> false` to disable the module.

Similarly, use `-setmodule <module's toggle id> true` to enable the module.

You can also execute `-listmodule` to view the modules (including toggle id).

## -op isnt working because it says command.op.start command.op.require command.op.require.cancel

Make sure you have enabled the resources pack of Matrix Anticheat. If it is not displaying, you can run the .mcaddon file again to let Minecraft installs that again.

## Where is the chat rank and anti spam feature?

You can do `-setmodule chatRank enable` to enable it.

Make sure to place Matrix below any addon with custom chat command.

It is in `Matrix_vX.X.X.mcaddon/BP/data/config.js` relatively.
